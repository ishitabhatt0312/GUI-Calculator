**Simple Calculator Using Tkinter**

**Description**

This mini project is a basic calculator application built using Python's tkinter library, which is used to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The calculator provides a simple interface with buttons to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes functionality to clear the input field and evaluate mathematical expressions.
This project is beginner-friendly and serves as an excellent introduction to GUI development in Python.

**Functionalities**

**Input Display:**
An entry field where users can see the numbers and operators they input.
It dynamically updates as users interact with the buttons.

**Number Buttons:**
Buttons for digits 0 through 9 to input numbers.

**Operator Buttons:**
Buttons for basic arithmetic operations:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Evaluation:

A button (=) to compute and display the result of the mathematical expression entered in the input field.
Clear Functionality:

A button (C) to clear the input field entirely.
